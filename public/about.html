<p>Beyond the world of coding and algorithms, my interests are broad and enriching.
   I find joy in solving programming problems and developing small projects that contribute to my continuous learning journey. 
   Outside the digital realm, I am an avid badminton player, a history book enthusiast, and a lover of anime series. 
   These interests serve as my outlets for creativity, relaxation, and personal growth.
